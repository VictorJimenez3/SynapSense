# SynapSense: Behavioral Monitoring through Neurotechnology

## Short Description
SynapSense is a real-time behavioral monitoring system that bridges raw device activity data with inferred emotional responses. By combining network traffic analysis, storage activity tracking, and neurotechnology-driven modeling, SynapSense opens new pathways for cognitive research, mental health applications, and human-computer interaction studies.

## Features
- **Real-Time Behavioral Inference**: Analyzes device activity patterns to infer emotional and cognitive states.
- **Neurotechnology Integration**: Leverages NLP (BERT) models to correlate digital behavior with human responses.
- **Scalable System Architecture**: C++ backend processing, React/Next.js frontend visualization, secure networking.
- **Research-Driven Applications**: Supports studies in mental health detection (e.g., depression signs, spatial neglect).

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: C++, Python, Linux networking tools.
- **Machine Learning**: BERT-based inference models for behavioral correlation.
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Infrastructure**: Modular system designed for real-time data streaming and analysis.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Behavioral Inference Complexity**: Tuned data pipelines to extract meaningful insights from noisy network and storage data.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Designed architecture to ensure that user device signals remained private while being analyzed.
- **Real-Time Processing Efficiency**: Built lightweight C++ modules and asynchronous pipelines to handle fast, continuous monitoring.

## Key Outcomes / Metrics
- **Working Prototype Delivered**: Functional demo system mapping device behavior to cognitive states.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Integration**: Successfully combined neurotech, machine learning, and backend engineering.
- **Research Potential**: Demonstrated early promise for cognitive health monitoring in non-invasive ways.

## How to Run It
Due to the nature of the project (local VM setup, hardware-specific networking tools), this repository does not contain a runnable public demo.

**Important Note**:  
Development was performed primarily on a local Virtual Machine environment for secure testing purposes.  
As a result, commits may not fully reflect contributions made during the build process.
